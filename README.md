### Hi! 👋

I'm Timo.
I develop stuff. Like this really useful VSCode extension: https://github.com/TimoBechtel/vscode-yolo  
(No, you may *actually* find something useful here, like https://github.com/TimoBechtel/mdlaunch)

Currently I'm doing a challenge I call the "111Challenge". Posting about this on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TimoBechtel).
